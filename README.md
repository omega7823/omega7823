  Hi I'm omega7823 and I am a student currently in the field of psychology.
One of my favorite things to do is gaming. Currently I stream GTA Online on console.
In my spare time I volunteer at a recovery center just for field experience with mental health personal
My future plans are to some day become a doctor so I can help others with there own disablities.
